read instructions.md and tell me what you think we are going to do

We're going to demonstrate using GitHub Copilot for product management and business analysis work—developing
   a hypothetical product from vision through user stories without actual implementation. I'll be helping you
   create documents in the /docs folder using markdown with dash-case filenames and British English spelling.

read the product vision I have supplied

Got it! You're building "Bitcoin Sniper" - a tool to detect periodic dips in Bitcoin prices and alert you (or
   eventually auto-buy) when there's a favourable buying opportunity. It's a personal project for one user (you)
   based on the hypothesis that Bitcoin price patterns are somewhat periodic. Starting with alerts before moving
   to automated trading

what research questions would you have at this time? Write them to a document.

I've added a csv file of daily bitcoin prices to the data folder. See if you can have a go at answering the first few
   research questions you listed under 'problem validation'. Write your findings to a file.
