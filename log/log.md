read instructions.md and tell me what you think we are going to do

We're going to demonstrate using GitHub Copilot for product management and business analysis work—developing
   a hypothetical product from vision through user stories without actual implementation. I'll be helping you
   create documents in the /docs folder using markdown with dash-case filenames and British English spelling.

read the product vision I have supplied

Got it! You're building "Bitcoin Sniper" - a tool to detect periodic dips in Bitcoin prices and alert you (or
   eventually auto-buy) when there's a favourable buying opportunity. It's a personal project for one user (you)
   based on the hypothesis that Bitcoin price patterns are somewhat periodic. Starting with alerts before moving
   to automated trading
