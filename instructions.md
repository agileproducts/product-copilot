# Instructions

## Aim of the project
Our aim here is to demomstrate the use of github copilot (that's you) for product management, business analysis and other aspects of software development which aren't actual coding. We will work on a hypothetical product idea from vision through to writing user stories, but we will not (at least for now) try to write any code or implement anything.

## Project structure
* Project documents should go in the `/docs` folder. 
* Data should go in `/data`.
* Any code written for tactical purposes eg. research or file manipulation should go in `/code`.

## Style guide
All documents should be written in markdown. Filenames should be in dash-case. Use British English.

If you have to write and run any python in the `/code` directory then always remember to use the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
