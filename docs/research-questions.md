# Research Questions

## Problem Validation
- Is there actually a periodic pattern in Bitcoin prices that can be reliably identified?
- What constitutes a "dip" or "minima"? Is it a percentage drop, standard deviations from mean, or relative to recent history?
- How frequently do these buying opportunities occur?
- What is the historical success rate of buying at identified dips versus random buying or regular DCA (dollar-cost averaging)?

## Technical Feasibility
- What data sources are available for Bitcoin prices? (APIs, frequency, reliability, cost)
- What granularity of data is needed? (daily, hourly, minute-by-minute?)
- What time period of historical data is required to identify patterns?
- What algorithms or techniques could identify periodic patterns? (statistical analysis, machine learning, technical indicators?)

## User Behaviour & Context
- What timeframe are you willing to wait between purchase opportunities? (daily, weekly, monthly?)
- What is your risk tolerance for false positives (buying when it's not actually optimal)?
- How quickly do you need to be alerted to act on an opportunity?
- What channels would be most effective for alerts? (email, SMS, push notification, dashboard?)
- What information would you need in an alert to make a decision?

## Financial & Practical Considerations
- What percentage improvement over simple DCA would justify the effort?
- Are there transaction fees or minimums that affect optimal buying frequency?
- What happens if multiple "good days to buy" occur in close succession?
- How much capital will be allocated per purchase opportunity?
- What exchange or platform will be used for actual purchases?

## Constraints & Risks
- What regulatory or compliance considerations exist for automated trading?
- What happens if the API or data source becomes unavailable?
- How will the system handle market volatility or "flash crashes"?
- What safeguards are needed to prevent buying during coordinated market manipulation?
- What is the backup plan if the hypothesis proves incorrect after implementation?

## Success Metrics
- How will we measure whether the system is working effectively?
- What baseline comparison will be used? (buy-and-hold, regular DCA, random buying?)
- Over what timeframe should success be evaluated?
- What return on investment would constitute success?
