# Research Findings: Success Measures

We should run the alert pilot for one quarter to assess whether it is working. 

We should compare the notional profit of buying a fixed sum of bitcoin on a price alert to that achieved by investing the same fixed sum once a fortnight and dollar cost averaging.

Success will be that net profits fron our trading strategy beat that from dollar cost averaging by a meaningful percentage. If the market falls generally it will be impossible to profit anyway, but success will look like a smaller loss.
