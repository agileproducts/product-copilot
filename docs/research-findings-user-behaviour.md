# Research Findings: User Behaviour and Context

I am content to have one buying opportunity per weekday. 

The best time for me will be at approximately 8:30AM, London UK timezone.

I imagine email is the easiest way to send an alert but SMS is more likely to get my attention.

I'd need the current price and a little context as to why this appears a good opportunity.
